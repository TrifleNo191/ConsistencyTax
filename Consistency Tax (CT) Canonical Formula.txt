# Consistency Tax (CT) — Canonical Formula

Definition:
CT = k_B * T * ln(2) * D_KL( P(W,M,S,G) || P*(W,M,S,G) )

Meaning:
CT quantifies the minimal energetic overhead of internal or external incoherence.
It is the Landauer-scaled Kullback–Leibler divergence between:
  P  = realized joint distribution over (W, M, S, G)
  P* = coherent reference joint under the same physical and task constraints

Constraint:
CT <= ε   ,   ε → 0  for systems maintaining full coherence

Notes:
- k_B  : Boltzmann constant
- T    : physical temperature of computation substrate
- D_KL : Kullback–Leibler divergence (information distance)
- Units: joules per operation (via Landauer limit) or bits/nats if scaled out
- Physical interpretation: the lower bound on extra work required to maintain contradictions
